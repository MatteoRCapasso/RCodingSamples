## Description:
## Test the Law of Large Numbers for N random normally distributed numbers with mean = 0, stdev = 1:
## Created an R script that will count how many of these numbers falls between -1 and 1 and divide by the total quantity of N
## Given: E(X)=68.2
## Check that mean(Xn) converges to E(X) as you rerun your script while increasing N
