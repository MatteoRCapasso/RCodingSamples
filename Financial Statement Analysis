## HOMEWORK: Financial Statement Analysis

## Question Prompt:
## You have been supplied with two vectors of data: monthly revenue and monthly expenses 
## for the financial year in question. Your task is to calculate the following financial metrics:

### Find Metrics: 
### - profit for each month
### - profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
### - profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue
### - good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
### - bad months - where profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
### - the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
### - the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year

### Note: 
### - All results need to be presented as vectors.
### - Results for the dollar values need to be calculated with $0.01 precision, but need to be pr
###   but need to be presented in Units of $1,000 (i.e. 1k) with no decimal points.
### - Results for the profit margin ratio need to be presented in units of % with no decimal points.
### - Your colleague has warned you that it is okay for tax for any given month
###   to be negative (in accounting terms, negative tax translates into a deferred tax asset).

#Given Data / Input
revenue <- c(14574.49, 7606.46, 8611.41, 9175.41, 8058.65, 8105.44, 11496.28, 9766.09, 10305.32, 14379.96, 10713.97, 15433.50)
expenses <- c(12051.82, 5695.07, 12319.20, 12089.72, 8658.57, 840.20, 3285.73, 5821.12, 6976.93, 16618.61, 10054.37, 3803.96)
taxRate <- 0.3

#Operations
# - profit for each month
monthlyProfit <- revenue - expenses 

# - profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
profitAfterTax <- round(monthlyProfit*(1-taxRate),2)

# - profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue
profitMarginPerMonth <- 100*round(profitAfterTax/revenue,2)

# - good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
goodMonths <- profitAfterTax > mean(profitAfterTax)

# - bad months - where profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
badMonths <- !goodMonths

# - the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
bestMonth <- max(monthlyProfit) == monthlyProfit

# - the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year
worstMonth <- min(monthlyProfit) == monthlyProfit


#Data Formatting
revenue <- round(revenue/1000)
expenses <- round(expenses/1000)
monthlyProfit <- round(monthlyProfit/1000)
profitAfterTax <- round(profitAfterTax/1000)

#Output
revenue
expenses
monthlyProfit
profitAfterTax
profitMarginPerMonth
goodMonths
badMonths
bestMonth
worstMonth


#matrices
m <- rbind(
  revenue,
  expenses,
  monthlyProfit,

  profitMarginPerMonth,
  goodMonths,
  badMonths,

  worstMonth
